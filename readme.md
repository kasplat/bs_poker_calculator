# BS Poker Calculator

This project was created to do a statistical analysis of the game BS poker. BS poker is a card game with rules as follows. A set number of cards is dealt to each player. The players go around a circle calling out higher and higher poker hands, trying to guess which poker hands can be adequately formed using the cards pooled together by all the players. Then when one player calls BS, all cards are revealed. If the last claim was true, the player who called BS loses. If it was false, the player who was convicted of BS loses.

## Acknowledgements:
* I found out later that <https://github.com/jenniezheng/BS_Poker_Chances_Calculator> accomplishes a similar task to what I was trying to accomplish. This solution is written in ruby with much fewer files, so it might be simpler for some people to follow. However, Jennie's appears to be more robust overall in terms of functionality, and has an associated website. Very impressive project!
